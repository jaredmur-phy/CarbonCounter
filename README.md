<u><b>CarbonCounter</b></u>


CarbonCounter is based off the book [How Bad Are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B004VO4IZY/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_TSJQQW7B48NCYFGY4MBS)!

It allows the user to track their weekly carbon footprint, saves their stats, and allows them to see their best weeks so far!
With multiple different options to track, like food, water and fuel, this app will give a comprehensive snapshot of how we are treating the planet.
After calculating, the user is prompted to save a screenshot of their results to brag to their friends about!
The app will also save all statistics inbetween runs, with a mercy button implemented to allow a user to reset all their statistics, to try for a fresh highscore!


<b><u>Install and Use:</b></u>


There are two ways to install
1. Download the project as a zip, unzip and open in Android Studio, or clone the repo into Android Studio.
2. Sync all gradle files (There are external library dependencies)
3. Run on a emulator through Android Device Manager, or connect a physical Android device and upload there if you are familiar. We recommend a basic emulator running <b>Android 7 or higher</b>
